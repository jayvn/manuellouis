# Instructions on updating the website

This is a simple website that you can easily update. Here's how:

## Changing Text

1.  **Open the HTML files:**
    *   You'll find files like `index.html`, `projects.html`, `hobbies.html`, and `photography.html`.
    *   Open these files with a text editor (like Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on Mac).

2.  **Find the text you want to change:**
    *   Look for the words you want to modify. They will be inside HTML tags like `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<li>`, etc.
    *   For example, to change "About Me" section, look for `<p>I am a project manager...</p>` in `index.html`.


## Adding Photos

1.  **Put your photos in the `images` folder:**
    *   To add photos to the photography page, place your image files (like `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, etc.) in the `images/photography` folder.
    *   The `photography.html` page will automatically display the images in this folder.
2. Update profile picture `./images/profile.jpg`
